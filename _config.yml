          I started this project as a way to learn <mark>Vue</mark> and <mark>Flask</mark>. After a visit to local shelter, I realized how difficult for stray animals to be adopted. Therefore, I built this animal adotion site using government open data to promote animal adoption. I have learned and polished my skills through this process and I'm very proud of having it in my portfolio.
